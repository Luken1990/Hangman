## Game Rules
* The Hangman game involves guessing words. A player guesses letters to determine an unknown word. When a player guesses too many letters that do not appear in the word, he/she is hanged/loses.
* You will be able to see all instances of your chosen letter in the answer if it appears anywhere.
* Every time you guess a wrong letter, you lose a life, and the hangman begins to appear.
